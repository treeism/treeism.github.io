This article is meant to explore a variety of perspectives within the community\n\nGENDERS AND PRONOUNS: Trans people argue that 'gender' and 'sex' are distinct categories, trans people believe that the \"sex\" is the value assigned at birth and \"gender\" is an abstract way to define ourselves and they listed 72 genders in total (1), they even defined other pronouns like \"xe/xer/xem\" and \"zie/zir/zirs\" (2).\nMisgendering, or using the wrong pronouns to refer to someone, can be offensive to trans people (3), a very popular social network called \"TikTok\" even started banning accounts that misgender people (4).\nThis can be confusing to many people since humans mentioned other humans using \"he/him\" or \"she/her\" for a very long time based on their sex. Many of these pronouns are not related to a person's physical sex and may not be easily identifiable.\n\nBIOLOGICAL TAKES: (coming soon)\n\n[Sources]\n\n1: https://www.medicinenet.com/what_are_the_72_other_genders/article.htm\n2: https://www.binghamton.edu/centers/lgbtq/pronoun_s.html#:~:text=They%20are%20linguistic%20tools%20that,in%20advance%20of%20meeting%20them.\n3: https://www.healthline.com/health/transgender/misgendering\n4: https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-news/tiktok-bans-misgendering-deadnaming-trans-people-rcna15386"}}
